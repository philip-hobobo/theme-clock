# theme-clock
Themed Minimalist Clock with Light and Dark Mode. Created for 50 Days of 50 Projects Udemy Course. Uses HTML, CSS, JScript
Decided to use 24 hour time format for universal use and included the year as well and styled the clock with a circle border to maintain a minimalist look but also outlines the clock so it isn't lost in the page.
